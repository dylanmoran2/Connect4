# Connect4
### Connect 4 Game Using C
Created this game for a class at UAlbany - ICSI 333 - Programming at the Hardware Software Interface

### How to Play
On Mac, open terminal and navigate to the directory containing the c file.

Run the command "gcc connect2.c -o connect2"

Then run "./connect2"

You may need to have command line tools installed for it to work.

Windows will be a little different but the same idea, run it in Command Line.
